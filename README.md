# workday-schedule

THE WHY:
    In this project I focused on what the user would need, and how it would help schedule a daily routine. From showing you the past hour and what should have been done, the current hour, and what you should be doing, to following hours, and what you'll need to do for the rest of the day. 

THE HOW:
    The following links were used as guides in JavaScript, and where I had most difficulty understanding the structure.
